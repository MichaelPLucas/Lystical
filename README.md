# Lystical

Lystical is a webapp based on rails that allows users to create and manage lists, with an emphasis on shopping lists.

### Why?

A problem I've found myself encountering frequently in the modern age of online shopping is a difficulty in keeping track of things that I want across multiple different sites. Say for instance that you have a few outfits you want to put together, but you keep finding articles of clothing that you can only get on amazon, or etsy, or ebay, or one of the many proprietary sites for different clothing companies. Trying to keep track of all of them at once can be a hassle. And so I present Lystical.
